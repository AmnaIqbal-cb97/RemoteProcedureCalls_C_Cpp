This Repository Contains Remote Procedure Calls using JSON, ProtoBuffers(Using GRPC) and XML. You'd need to set GRPC in your system prior to usage of protobuf RPC. Use the following link to guide you through the process of setup https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/grpc/grpc/+/HEAD/BUILDING.md
These simple RPCs have 2 functions deployed:
  1) Return a sum of two numbers
  2) Return total number of calls to the server for RPCs
